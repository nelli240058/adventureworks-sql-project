# AdventureWorks SQL Project 

This project is part of the SQL & Databases module at Turing College.  
It uses the `adwentureworks_db` dataset from Google BigQuery to explore and analyze product and manufacturing-related data.

### Project Description

The goal of this project is to:
- Explore the AdventureWorks 2005 database using SQL
- Write queries to retrieve, join, and aggregate data across multiple tables
- Practice SQL best practices, including code readability, naming conventions, and result validation
- Fix and improve pre-written SQL queries
